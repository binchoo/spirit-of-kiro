# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modernizes the game's deployment approach by eliminating Docker containers in favor of native Node.js and npm execution. The modernization includes replacing the local DynamoDB setup with real Amazon DynamoDB tables and providing Windows CMD batch scripts for Cognito User Pool configuration. This change aims to simplify the development workspace preparation and make the deployment process more efficient for developers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the game server natively with Node.js instead of Docker containers, so that I can have faster startup times and simpler local development setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the server THEN the system SHALL execute using native Node.js without Docker containers
2. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL use npm scripts for all build and execution tasks
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL use standard npm/bun package management without containerization
4. WHEN the development environment is prepared THEN the system SHALL NOT require Docker or docker-compose commands

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use real Amazon DynamoDB tables instead of local DynamoDB, so that I can work with production-like data storage and eliminate local database setup complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application connects to the database THEN the system SHALL connect to real Amazon DynamoDB tables
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use AWS SDK for DynamoDB without local DynamoDB containers
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL authenticate with AWS using proper credentials
4. WHEN database tables are needed THEN the system SHALL create or reference existing DynamoDB tables in AWS
5. IF DynamoDB tables do not exist THEN the system SHALL provide scripts to create the required table structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Windows developer, I want Windows CMD batch scripts for Cognito User Pool setup, so that I can easily configure authentication services from my Windows development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Cognito THEN the system SHALL provide Windows CMD batch scripts (.bat files)
2. WHEN running Cognito setup scripts THEN the system SHALL create or configure AWS Cognito User Pools
3. WHEN authentication is configured THEN the system SHALL update application configuration with Cognito settings
4. WHEN setup is complete THEN the system SHALL verify Cognito integration is working properly
5. IF setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified workspace preparation, so that I can get the development environment running with minimal setup steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing the workspace THEN the system SHALL eliminate Docker-related setup steps
2. WHEN following setup instructions THEN the system SHALL require only Node.js, npm, and AWS CLI as prerequisites
3. WHEN running setup scripts THEN the system SHALL automatically configure all necessary AWS resources
4. WHEN the setup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a single command to start the entire application
5. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for common issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the item-images service to run natively, so that I can develop and debug the image generation functionality without container overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the item-images service starts THEN the system SHALL run natively using Node.js
2. WHEN image generation is requested THEN the system SHALL process requests without Docker containers
3. WHEN connecting to external services THEN the system SHALL use native AWS SDK connections
4. WHEN the service scales THEN the system SHALL rely on AWS native scaling instead of container orchestration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated configuration management, so that I can easily switch between development and production environments without Docker-specific settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL use native environment variables without Docker compose
2. WHEN switching environments THEN the system SHALL support development, staging, and production configurations
3. WHEN AWS services are configured THEN the system SHALL use standard AWS configuration methods
4. WHEN secrets are managed THEN the system SHALL integrate with AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation errors and guidance

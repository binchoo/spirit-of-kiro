"A mighty figure stands before you, their ethereal Viking beard flowing and braiding itself in an unseen wind, the silvery spectral strands reaching down to their chest even as you watch it grow. In their hand, they clutch the chrome-and-runes ValhallaMix 3000, its blue-tinged dwarven steel beaters catching the light like miniature axes. The air around them thrums with ancient kitchen-magic, punctuated by the occasional spark from the mixer's runic dials and the faint echo of distant war chants. Their eyes hold the determined gleam of a culinary warrior, and a light dusting of flour on their apocalypse-weathered clothing suggests they've recently emerged victorious from battle with some bread dough, no doubt producing perfectly boat-shaped loaves worthy of Odin's feast hall."
